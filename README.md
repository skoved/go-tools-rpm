# Go Tools Packaged for Fedora

I do a lot of programming in Go and I use Fedora. It is a really nice combo for the most part, but it is frustrating
that a few of the common tools are not packaged. This repo is my attempt to package these tools to make them easy to
install and manage on your system.
